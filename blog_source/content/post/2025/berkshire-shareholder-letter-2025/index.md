# 直面问题与行动哲学

**Problems, he would tell me, cannot be wished away. They require action, however uncomfortable that may be.**

During the 2019-23 period, I have used the words “mistake” or “error” 16 times in my letters to you. Many other huge companies have never used either word over that span. Amazon, I should acknowledge, made some brutally candid observations in its 2021 letter. Elsewhere, it has generally been happy talk and pictures.


**查理总是告诉我：问题不会凭空消失，它们需要行动，无论这件事多么令人不适。**

在 2019-2023 年间，我在写给你的股东信中共使用了16次“错误”或“失误”这个词。与此同时，许多庞大的企业在这五年间从未承认过任何错误。不过，我得说，亚马逊在2021年的股东信中做出了一些极其坦诚的反思。但在大多数情况下，外界看到的只是“正能量”的宣传和精美的图片。

# 商业模式与决策的复杂性

Every company doesn’t have an **easy-to-understand business** and there are very few owners or managers like Pete. And, of course, I expect to make my share of mistakes about the businesses Berkshire buys and sometimes err in evaluating the sort of person with whom I’m dealing.

并不是每家公司都拥有**清晰易懂的商业模式**，而且像彼特这样的杰出企业家和管理者更是凤毛麟角。当然，伯克希尔在收购业务时，我难免会犯错，有时在评估生意本身时判断失误，有时则是在评估与我打交道的人时看走眼。

<br/>
<br/>

And our experience is that a single winning decision can make a breathtaking difference over time. **Mistakes fade away; winners can forever blossom.**

我们的经验表明，一个正确的决策，足以带来惊人的长期回报。**错误终会被遗忘，而赢家可以持续开花结果。**

# 人才选拔：能力重于学历

One further point in our CEO selections: I never look at where a candidate has gone to school. Never! 

Of course, there are great managers who attended the most famous schools. But there are plenty such as Pete who may have benefitted by attending a less prestigious institution or even by not bothering to finish school. Look at my friend, Bill Gates, who decided that it was far more important to get underway in an exploding industry that would change the world than it was to stick around for a parchment that he could hang on the wall. (Read his new book, Source Code.)

在挑选CEO时，我从不关心候选人在哪所学校就读，绝对不会！

当然，顶级学府也培养出了一些优秀的管理者。但与此同时，还有很多像彼特这样的人，他们或许从非名校毕业，甚至干脆没有完成学业，但这并不妨碍他们成为卓越的商业领袖。看看我的朋友比尔·盖茨（Bill Gates），他选择投身正在改变世界的爆炸性行业，而不是留在校园里拿一张可以挂在墙上的文凭。（推荐阅读他的新书《源代码》）

I was lucky enough to get an education at three fine universities. And **I avidly believe in lifelong learning**. I’ve observed, however, that a very large portion of business talent is innate with nature swamping nurture.

我很幸运，曾在三所优秀的大学接受教育，并且**我坚信终身学习的价值**。但在我的观察中，绝大部分商业才能来自天赋，而非教育培养。

# 财务指标与长期投资逻辑

All told, we recorded **operating earnings** of $47.4 billion in 2024. We regularly – endlessly, some readers may groan – emphasize this measure rather than the GAAP-mandated earnings that are reported on page K-68.

Our measure excludes capital gains or losses on the stocks and bonds we own, whether realized or unrealized. Over time, we think it highly likely that gains will prevail – why else would we buy these securities? – though the year-by-year numbers will swing wildly and unpredictably. Our horizon for such commitments is almost always far longer than a single year. In many, our thinking involves decades. These long-termers are the purchases that sometimes make the cash register ring like church bells.

Here’s a breakdown of the 2023-24 earnings as we see them. All calculations are after depreciation, amortization and income tax. EBITDA, a flawed favorite of Wall Street, is not for us.

2024年，我们**营业利润**474亿美元。尽管某些读者可能对我们的反复强调感到厌倦，但我们必须重申：相较于（年报）第K-68页按通用会计准则（GAAP）要求列示的利润，**这个运营利润指标更能反映企业真实经营状况**。

我们采用的指标不包含我们所持股票和债券的资本收益或损失，无论这些收益或损失是已实现的还是未实现的。从长期来看，我们认为获利的可能性极大——否则，我们又为何要投资这些证券呢？不过，这些投资的年度波动将是剧烈且不可预测的。我们的投资视野几乎总是远超一年，在许多情况下，我们的思考跨度是数十年。正是这些长期持有的资产，时不时会让“收银机”响得像教堂钟声一样。

以下是我们对 2023-2024年盈利的分类计算。所有数据均为扣除折旧、摊销及所得税后的结果。至于EBITDA ——华尔街的“心头好”，但在我们看来，这是个有缺陷的指标，因此我们从不使用它。

# 投资机遇与市场耐心

**Understandably, really outstanding businesses are very seldom offered in their entirety, but small fractions of these gems can be purchased Monday through Friday on Wall Street and, very occasionally, they sell at bargain prices.**

Often, nothing looks compelling; very infrequently we find ourselves knee-deep in opportunities.

**毫无疑问，真正卓越的企业几乎从不会整体出售，但它们的少量股份每周一至周五都可以在华尔街买到，并且偶尔还能邂逅折价良机。**

多数时候，市场上并无令人兴奋的机会；但在极少数情况下，我们也会迎来机遇遍地的时刻。

# 资产配置：股票优于现金

Despite what some commentators currently view as an extraordinary cash position at Berkshire, the great majority of your money remains in equities. That preference won’t change.

Berkshire shareholders can rest assured that we will forever deploy a substantial majority of their money in equities – mostly American equities although many of these will have international operations of significance. **Berkshire will never prefer ownership of cash-equivalent assets over the ownership of good businesses, whether controlled or only partially owned.**

Paper money can see its value evaporate if fiscal folly prevails. In some countries, this reckless practice has become habitual, and, in our country’s short history, the U.S. has come close to the edge. Fixed-coupon bonds provide no protection against runaway currency.

Businesses, as well as individuals with desired talents, however, will usually find a way to cope with monetary instability as long as their goods or services are desired by the country’s citizenry. So, too, with personal skills. **Lacking such assets as athletic excellence, a wonderful voice, medical or legal skills or, for that matter, any special talents, I have had to rely on equities throughout my life. In effect, I have depended on the success of American businesses and I will continue to do so.**

尽管部分评论人士将伯克希尔当前的现金储备视为“异常庞大”，但绝大多数资金仍然投向了股票，这一偏好不会改变。

伯克希尔的股东可以放心，我们始终会将大部分资金投入股票——主要是美国企业，但其中许多公司在全球市场也有着重要业务。**伯克希尔永远不会偏好持有现金等价物，而忽视优质企业的股权，无论是控股还是部分持有。** 

纸币的价值可能因财政失控而蒸发。在某些国家，这种情况已成为常态，而在美国的短暂历史中，我们也曾多次逼近危险边缘。固定利息债券在货币贬值面前毫无防御能力。

然而，企业以及拥有稀缺技能的个人，通常能找到应对货币不稳定的方法，只要他们的商品或服务仍然被市场所需要。个人技能亦然。**不像那些天赋异禀的人——比如拥有卓越运动能力、非凡嗓音、精湛医术或法律才能，我没有任何特殊技能，因此只能一生依赖股票投资。换句话说，我一直依靠美国企业的成功，并将继续如此。**

# 企业生命力与国家土壤

Berkshire’s activities now impact all corners of our country. And we are not finished. Companies die for many reasons but, unlike the fate of humans, old age itself is not lethal. Berkshire today is far more youthful than it was in 1965.

However, as Charlie and I have always acknowledged, Berkshire would not have achieved its results in any locale except America whereas America would have been every bit the success it has been if Berkshire had never existed.
企业的消亡可能有很多原因，但不同于人的命运，企业不会因“年老”而死亡。事实上，**伯克希尔今天比1965年时更加年轻。**

然而，正如查理和我一直强调的：伯克希尔的成功，只有在美国才能实现；但如果伯克希尔从未存在，美国依然会取得今天的辉煌成就。

# 全球化布局与货币中性策略

A small but important exception to our U.S.-based focus is our growing investment in Japan.

It’s been almost six years since Berkshire began purchasing shares in five Japanese companies that very successfully operate in a manner somewhat similar to Berkshire itself. The five are (alphabetically) ITOCHU, Marubeni, Mitsubishi, Mitsui and Sumitomo. Each of these large enterprises, in turn, owns interests in a vast array of businesses, many based in Japan but others that operate throughout the world.

**Over time, you will likely see Berkshire’s ownership of all five increase somewhat.**

Meanwhile, Berkshire has consistently – but not pursuant to any formula – increased its yen-denominated borrowings. All are at fixed rates, no “floaters.” **Greg and I have no view on future foreign exchange rates and therefore seek a position approximating currency-neutrality.**

虽然伯克希尔主要专注于美国市场，但有一个很小但却很重要的例外，那就是我们在日本不断增长的投资。

距伯克希尔首次买入五家日本公司的股份，已经接近六年。这五家公司在运营模式上与伯克希尔有诸多相似之处，并且表现极为出色。它们分别是（按字母顺序排列）：伊藤忠商事（ITOCHU）、丸红（Marubeni）、三菱商事（Mitsubishi）、三井物产（Mitsui）、住友商事（Sumitomo）。每一家企业都拥有广泛的业务版图，其中许多业务扎根日本，但也有些企业业务遍布全球。

**未来，你可能会看到伯克希尔对这五家公司的持股比例有所增加。**

与此同时，伯克希尔持续增加日元计价债务，但并未按照任何特定公式操作。所有债务均为固定利率，没有“浮动利率债务（floaters）”。**格雷格和我对未来的外汇汇率没有任何看法，因此寻求一种近似于货币中性的头寸。**
